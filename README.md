This is a front-end facing development of a design I saw on dribble. The original designer goes by the name Glenn Catteeuw https://dribbble.com/shots/7905357-DPS-Intro-Side-Menu-Animation. I thought of just developing it to help learn some concepts that I might have forgotten. This is created using HTML, SCSS and JS.
